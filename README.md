This android application was developed using Java in Android Studio. The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with different android constraint layouts and views, as well as different event listeners.

## Game Flow
-- -- 
There are 6 different possible fruits that can be displayed for each ImageView on the 5x5 grid of the UI. When the game is initialized the entire grid is randomly populated with the different fruit options, the game will randomly choose what you are trying to match and display how many are on the screen to find.

Every time the user selects the correct fruit, their selection is grayed out and the remaining fruit are shuffled around the selected option.

Once the user has found all of the specified options, an AlertDialog pops up with a congratulation message saying that the user has found all of the specified options.

Pressing the "OK" button inside the dialog box or pressing the "Reset" button in the game screen will restart the game with a different fruit selected as well as a different number of the selected fruit to find.
